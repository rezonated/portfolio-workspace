The Boids algorithm, created by Craig Reynolds in 1986, offers a powerful solution. It demonstrates how complex, life-like group motion can emerge from individuals following a few simple rules, without any central leader or complex choreography.
This principle offers a way to add life to game worlds. A common application is simulating a school of fish, but a significant technical challenge arises when scaling up to large numbers.</description></item><item><title>TNonNullPtr: UE's bouncer for null pointers!</title><link>https://rezonated.github.io/posts/tnonnullptr/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rezonated.github.io/posts/tnonnullptr/</guid><description>Introduction If you&amp;rsquo;ve spent any time writing gameplay code in Unreal&amp;rsquo;s C++, you know the routine. The code we all have to write.
Before you can safely use a pointer, you have to check it. This defensive habit is essential for preventing crashes, but it often leads to code that looks like this:
1void AMyGameMode::StartRound(const AController* PlayerController) 2{ 3	if (PlayerController) 4	{ 5	if (PlayerController-&amp;gt;GetPawn&amp;lt;AMyCharacter&amp;gt;()) 6	{ 7	if (PlayerController-&amp;gt;GetPawn&amp;lt;AMyCharacter&amp;gt;()-&amp;gt;GetMyWeaponComponent()) 8	{ 9	PlayerController-&amp;gt;GetPawn&amp;lt;AMyCharacter&amp;gt;()-&amp;gt;GetMyWeaponComponent()-&amp;gt;EquipWeapon(); 10	} 11	} 12	} 13} This code is safe, perfectly fine.</description></item><item><title>Approaches to replicate Unreal Engine's TMap</title><link>https://rezonated.github.io/posts/tmap_replication/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rezonated.github.io/posts/tmap_replication/</guid><description>Introduction If you ever attempt to put a Replicated specifier on your UPROPERTY with TMap, your IDE or compiler might yell at you like this:
Why can&amp;rsquo;t TMap be replicated by Unreal? Unreal&amp;rsquo;s built-in replication only supports certain types that the replication system knows how to serialize. This includes basic primitives, some containers like TArray, FVector, or custom structs containing UPROPERTY fields.
TMap is considered a dynamic container because of its non-fixed size, ordering, and hashing behavior.</description></item><item><title>Networked Deterministic Array Shuffle in Unreal Engine</title><link>https://rezonated.github.io/posts/deterministic_shuffle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rezonated.github.io/posts/deterministic_shuffle/</guid><description>Introduction Sometimes, you want to do a deterministic shuffle of an array for purposes like gacha mechanics, or in my case, replicating the Spin the Wheel minigame in Coral Island!
At the time this feature was developed, it hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet been made to work with multiplayer. Even though Coral Island is a co-op game, not a competitive one, Unreal Engine still adopts a server-authoritative multiplayer model.
The server must always act as the single source of truth.</description></item></channel></rss>
