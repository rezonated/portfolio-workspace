The Boids algorithm, created by Craig Reynolds in 1986, offers a powerful solution. It demonstrates how complex, life-like group motion can emerge from individuals following a few simple rules, without any central leader or complex choreography.
This principle offers a way to add life to game worlds. A common application is simulating a school of fish, but a significant technical challenge arises when scaling up to large numbers.</description></item></channel></rss>
