Why can&amp;rsquo;t TMap be replicated by Unreal? Unreal&amp;rsquo;s built-in replication only supports certain types that the replication system knows how to serialize. This includes basic primitives, some containers like TArray, FVector, or custom structs containing UPROPERTY fields.
TMap is considered a dynamic container because of its non-fixed size, ordering, and hashing behavior.</description></item><item><title>Networked Deterministic Array Shuffle in Unreal Engine</title><link>https://rezonated.github.io/posts/deterministic_shuffle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rezonated.github.io/posts/deterministic_shuffle/</guid><description>Introduction Sometimes, you want to do a deterministic shuffle of an array for purposes like gacha mechanics, or in my case, replicating the Spin the Wheel minigame in Coral Island!
At the time this feature was developed, it hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet been made to work with multiplayer. Even though Coral Island is a co-op game, not a competitive one, Unreal Engine still adopts a server-authoritative multiplayer model.
The server must always act as the single source of truth.</description></item></channel></rss>
